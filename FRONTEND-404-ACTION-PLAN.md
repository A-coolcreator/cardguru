# CardGuru Frontend - Action Plan for 404 Resolution

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Step 1: Fresh React Environment (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Rationale**: Complete reset eliminates any hidden configuration conflicts
```bash
# Create new Vite React project
npm create vite@latest cardguru-frontend-new -- --template react-ts
cd cardguru-frontend-new
npm install

# Test basic functionality first
npm run dev
# Verify http://localhost:5173/ loads correctly
```

### Step 2: Systematic Component Migration
**If Step 1 works, migrate components one by one:**
1. Copy `src/App.tsx` (simple version first)
2. Copy `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` (without complex imports)
3. Test after each migration to identify the breaking component

### Step 3: Alternative Development Server
**If Vite continues to fail, try webpack:**
```bash
npx create-react-app cardguru-frontend-webpack --template typescript
# Migrate components to webpack-based setup
```

### Step 4: Environment Investigation
**Check for system-specific issues:**
- Try different terminal (Command Prompt vs PowerShell vs Git Bash)
- Test on different port: `npm run dev -- --port 3001`
- Check VS Code extensions that might interfere
- Test with minimal VS Code extensions

### Step 5: Dependency Analysis
**If issues persist, check specific dependencies:**
- Test with React v18 instead of v19
- Remove Tailwind CSS completely (use basic CSS)
- Remove React Router (single page first)
- Remove React Query (basic fetch)

## üîç Diagnostic Questions to Answer

### Configuration Issues
- [ ] Does a fresh Vite React project work on this system?
- [ ] Does the problem occur with basic HTML files served by Vite?
- [ ] Are there any Windows-specific file permissions issues?

### Dependency Conflicts
- [ ] Does the issue occur without Tailwind CSS?
- [ ] Does the issue occur with React v18?
- [ ] Does the issue occur without React Router?

### Environment Issues
- [ ] Does the issue occur in different terminals?
- [ ] Does the issue occur with different ports?
- [ ] Does the issue occur with minimal VS Code setup?

## üéØ Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Fix
- [ ] Basic React app loads on localhost
- [ ] Can see "Hello World" in browser
- [ ] Hot reload works for development

### Full Resolution
- [ ] All existing components work correctly
- [ ] API integration functional
- [ ] Tailwind CSS styling works
- [ ] All routes accessible

## üìù Documentation Requirements

### When Issue is Resolved
- Document the root cause in `FRONTEND-404-ANALYSIS.md`
- Update `SPRINT2-PROGRESS.md` with resolution steps
- Create troubleshooting guide for future reference

### If Issue Persists
- Document alternative solutions attempted
- Consider different tech stack recommendations
- Evaluate timeline impact on project delivery

---
**Timeline**: Allocate 2-4 hours for systematic resolution attempt
**Fallback**: If unresolved, consider backend-first approach with API documentation
