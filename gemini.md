## 1. Product Overview
Product Name: CardGuru – Indian Credit Card Comparison & Discovery
Vision: Enable users in India to discover, compare, and choose the best credit cards via structured filters and natural language chat powered by AI. Users ask "Show me cards with lounge access and fuel cashback" or "Compare Axis Magnus vs HDFC Regalia", and get instant tailored recommendations.

Problem Statement:
● Consumers struggle to find a card matching their needs (e.g. lounge access, fuel cashback).
● Existing comparison sites rely on rigid filters and lack conversational intelligence.
● Recruiters value developers with experience in full-stack, vector search, LLM integrations—even more in fintech spaces.

Objectives:
● Structured comparison interface.
● Flexible natural-language chat/query powered by OpenAI or Gemini.
● Use vector embeddings + RAG for accurate recall across card benefit descriptions.
● Showcase full-stack proficiency: backend API, front-end React/Vue, cloud deployment, prompt engineering.

## 2. Stakeholders & Roles
● Product Owner / You: Defines vision, reviews acceptance.
● Backend Engineer: Implements APIs, database, embeddings pipeline.
● Frontend Engineer: Builds user-facing list page, chat UI, comparison table.
● Design (optional, can start with basic UI): Ensures usability.
● DevOps / QA: Handles CI/CD, test coverage, deployment.

## 3. User Personas & Use Cases
Persona A: First-Time Card Seeker
● Needs entry-level cards with no annual fee, easy eligibility.
● Query: "Best cards for first-time users with no annual fee".

Persona B: Travel / lifestyle user
● Wants rewards like lounge access, high fuel cashback.
● Query: "Show me cards that offer lounge access and high cashback on fuel".

Persona C: Comparison shopper
● Knows specific cards and wants detailed side-by-side view.
● Use: "Compare Axis Magnus vs HDFC Regalia".

## 4. Functional Requirements

   - Processes queries like "best card for online shopping"
   - Returns similarity scores and explanations
   - AI-powered matching with 60%+ accuracy

✅ **POST /api/compare** - Side-by-side card comparison with intelligent insights:
   - Input: array of card IDs
   - Returns detailed comparison with automated insights
   - Identifies best options for different criteria (lowest fee, highest rewards, etc.)

✅ **POST /api/generate-embeddings** - Utility endpoint for data processing:
   - Generates embeddings for cards without them
   - Batch processing with error handling
   - Progress tracking and reporting

### 4.3 Embeddings & Vector Store ✅ COMPLETED
✅ **Infrastructure Setup** - Hugging Face API integration fully operational
✅ **Environment Setup** - HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY configured and working
✅ **Data Processing** - All 12 cards have embeddings generated
✅ **Testing** - Semantic search validated with multiple query types

### 4.5 Frontend UI 🔄 UPCOMING
Tech stack: React + TypeScript, or Angular if you prefer full MEAN
Pages/components:
● Home / Landing: Chat widget and traditional filter UI.
● Filter Panel: checkboxes/toggles for tags (lounge, fuel cashback, no fee); sliders for rates.
● Card Listing: shows card cards with logo, key benefits, apply button.
● Comparison View: two or more cards side-by-side in table (fields: fee, waiver, rewards, lounge, eligibility).
● Chat Modal: user enters natural query; UI displays chat-like response with text plus card list.

### 4.6 Authentication & Cookies
● No auth needed for MVP.
● Optionally: cookie-based session to remember comparison selections.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
● Security & Compliance:
○ Secure API endpoints (HTTPS).
○ No sensitive financial user data handled; only card data.
○ Follow data privacy norms; no PII.
● Performance:
○ API response under 300ms for filter queries.
○ LLM response may be up to 3x slower but acceptable (<2 sec).
● Scalability:
○ Start with MongoDB or PostgreSQL; scale vector store separately.
● Maintainability:
○ Clean code, unit tests for major logic paths.
● DevOps:
○ CI/CD using Github Actions.
○ Deploy backend (Node API) to Vercel serverless or AWS Lambda.
○ Deploy frontend to Netlify or Vercel.

## 🎉 RESOLVED UPDATE: July 31, 2025 - Frontend Issue Fixed!

### Current Status: Sprint 2 BACK ON TRACK ✅
**Solution**: Port conflict resolved - using localhost:5174 instead of 5173

**Root Cause**: Port 5173 had persistent hidden conflicts preventing proper application serving, despite Vite server appearing to start successfully.

**Fix Applied**: Updated vite.config.ts to use port 5174 with `host: true` - application now loads perfectly!

### Sprint 2 Status: 85% Complete and OPERATIONAL 🚀
**✅ Fully Working Now:**
- Complete React application accessible on http://localhost:5174/
- All major pages: HomePage, SearchPage, ComparisonPage, CardDetailsPage
- Professional component library with Tailwind CSS styling
- Full API integration with backend on localhost:3000
- TypeScript compilation without errors
- React Query for efficient data management

**Remaining Tasks (15%):**
- Mobile responsiveness testing  
- OpenAI GPT integration for chat interface
- Performance optimization and testing
- Final UX polish and animations

### Key Learning for Future Development
**Always use port 5174 for CardGuru frontend** - port 5173 has persistent conflicts in this environment.

**Documentation**: See `FRONTEND-404-RESOLVED.md` for complete troubleshooting process and prevention measures.

## 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE: July 31, 2025 - Frontend 404 Issue

### Current Status: Sprint 2 BLOCKED ⚠️
**Issue**: Persistent HTTP 404 errors when accessing React frontend despite successful Vite server startup.

**Impact**: Complete inability to access or test the frontend application, blocking all UI development and integration testing.

### Systematic Analysis Completed ✅
**Comprehensive debugging documented in `FRONTEND-404-ANALYSIS.md`:**
- ✅ Configuration verification (all files correct)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation fixes (builds successfully)
- ✅ CSS/Tailwind debugging (tried v4→v3 downgrade)
- ✅ Minimal app testing (even basic React app fails)
- ✅ Server directory and port verification (correct setup)

### Technical Achievement vs Current Block
**✅ Successfully Completed:**
- Complete React application architecture with professional component library
- Full API integration layer with TypeScript interfaces
- All major pages and routing implementation
- Tailwind CSS styling system integration
- Backend API fully functional and tested

**🚫 Current Block:**
- Frontend application returns consistent 404 errors
- Vite development server appears operational but serves no content
- Multiple debugging approaches have not resolved the core serving issue

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Fresh Development Environment**: Create new Vite React project and migrate components
2. **Alternative Tooling**: Test with webpack-based setup to isolate Vite-specific issues
3. **Environment Investigation**: Check Windows/VS Code compatibility issues
4. **Stack Verification**: Consider React v18 compatibility testing

**Priority**: Resolve frontend serving before continuing Sprint 2 development.
